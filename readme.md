### Lesson -3 Express Router and Route

to use expres router need to import router from -> express.Router()
then use like that ->
router.get(...)
router.post(...)

** It's recomonded to create a diffrent folder for routing coz there can be lot of route so if we write all the code in app.js it will be mess up.

After writing route in route file then export that file route and inclune or require to app.js file and add app.use(thename using you imported the route)
